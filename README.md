**Django** is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
   
**MySQL** is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability.
